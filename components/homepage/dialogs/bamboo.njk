<p>
  <i><a href="https://github.com/3elDU/bamboo" target="_blank">Bamboo</a></i> is my top-down sandbox game. I started
  developing
  it in late 2022 as i was learning
  <a href="https://go.dev" target="_blank">Go</a>.<br>
  I used <a href="https://ebitengine.org" target="_blank">Ebitengine</a> as a rendering engine.<br>
  That idea of building a "top-down minecraft" went a long way, I've added a lot of features, and had a lot of fun with
  this project.
</p>

<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>
  You start in a procedurally generated world with trees, ocean and vegetation.
  Chopping trees gives you sticks and saplings. Sticks can be used in crafting, while samplings can be planted to grow
  more trees.<br>
  There is a crafting system for crafting items, while some entities can be creating by placing stuff on the ground,
  such
  as the campfire.
</p>

<h1>Development</h1>
<p>
  I started progress in late 2022, and it has stalled in late 2023. It has been a great journey and I'm quite proud of
  the project.<br>
  I've drawn my own font, all textures except player's are also by me, and I've wrote a whole UI library in Go just to
  draw some buttons on screen
