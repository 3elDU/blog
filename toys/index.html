    <h1>Toy projects</h1>
    <p>
      This is the collection of my pet projects that were made to learn more
      about a particular technology, implement an idea that I had in my head for
      a long time, kill time, etc., but they are still cool, so I'm showing them
      here.<br />
      Each project listen here runs directly in the browser, so you can play
      with them too!

        <p>
          A raytracer algorithm written in Rust. You can create shapes, edit
          their positions and colors, and render the image.<br />
          Made possible on the web thanks to WASM

        </h3>
        <p>
          A genetic algorithm, simulating the evolution of cells in a virtual
          petri dish.<br />
          Each cell can be inspected, and the overall performance has been
          highly optimized by moving the simulation to the separate Web Worker.
